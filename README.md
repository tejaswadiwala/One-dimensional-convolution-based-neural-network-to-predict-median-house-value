# One dimensional convolution based neural network to predict median house value
This is my completed assignment for the course Natural Language Processing (COMP-5413) at Lakehead University.

**NLP_Assignment_1.pdf**:  
  is the assignment question

**0889445_NLP_Assignment_1.ipynb**:  
  is my completed code for the assignment question.

**0889445_NLP_Assignment_1.pdf**:  
  is the IEEE style paper that I wrote for the assignment question.

**0889445_1dconv_reg**:  
  is my model that is used for the assignment question.

**Highest_R2_score_model.PNG**:  
  is a screenshot of the highest R2 score that my model gave.

**Subplot.png**:  
  is the graph of the sub-plots of the first eighteen samples from the dataset. 

**housing.csv**:  
  is the dataset that is used.

## To run the code:

1. Open the 0889445_NLP_Assignment_1.ipynb in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset housing.csv to Google Drive.
3. Change the location of the dataset to match your Google Drive.
4. Go to Run -> Run all.
